I’m interested in how principles from non-equilibrium statistical physics can inform models of living systems.

### Themes
- **Stochastic dynamics & inference** — parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for SDE/CTMC models.
- **Information processing in cells** — limits to sensing, signaling, and decision making.
- **Interacting networks** — dynamics on graphs; coarse-graining and model reduction.
