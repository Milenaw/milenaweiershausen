Hi, I’m **Marc**.

I work on theoretical physics and system biology problems with a focus on stochastic processes, multi-scale modeling, and data-driven inference in biological networks. My group collaborates with experimental labs to connect models with measurable phenotypes.

Representative topics: non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of gene regulation, information thermodynamics in cells, and dynamics on multilayer networks.
